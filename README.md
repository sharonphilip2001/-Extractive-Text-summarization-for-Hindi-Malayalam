Extractive Text Summarization is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies and extracts key sentences or phrases from a given text to form a concise summary. Unlike abstractive summarization, which generates new text, extractive summarization selects the most relevant sentences without altering the original content. It relies on methods like word frequency analysis, positional importance, and machine learning models to determine which sentences contribute the most meaningful information. This technique is commonly used for summarizing articles, news reports, research papers, and other lengthy documents where quick insights are needed.
